Boat uses a special port of openjdk8 (https://github.com/CosineMath/openjdk-jdk8u-aarch32-android) to run Minecraft. A special version of LWJGL (https://github.com/CosineMath/lwjgl-boat) designed for Boat support to support Minecraft is included.

Some other important components are gl4es (https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es) and openal-soft (https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft).

A crash-catching module (https://github.com/ivanarh/jndcrash) is used to print crash logs.
